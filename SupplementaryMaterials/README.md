# Supplementary Materials for the manuscript

This folder includes the suplementary materials for our manuscript "CAbiNet:Joint visualization of cells and genes based on a gene-cell association graph" that can be found here: ADD LINK TO PAPER.

Here we offer the interactive version of biMAPs and 3d plots discussed in our paper. For how the interactive html files were generated, please refer to the scripts in ../Results folder. 

Detailed information of the files are:

* Figure2a_PBMC10x_CAbiNet_plotly.html
    - Interactive biMAP of PBMC10x data in Fig.2a. Please put the mouse cursor over the points, the information (type/biclustering/name) will automatically printed to screen.
    
* Fig3a_tabula_muris_biMAP_interactive.html
    - Interactive scatter biMAP for the tabula muris data.

* Fig3a_tabula_muris_hex_biMAP_interactive.html
    - Interactive biMAP with cells binned in hexagons for easier browsing of the genes for the tabula muris data.

* Fig4a_brain_organoids_hex_biMAP_interactive.html
    - Interactive scatter biMAP for the brain organoid data.

* Fig4a_brain_organoids_hex_biMAP_interactive.html
    - Interactive biMAP with cells binned in hexagons for easier browsing of the genes for the brain organoid data.
    
* Figure5b_DmelSpatial_CAbiNet_plotly.html
    - Interactive biMAP of DemlSpatial data.
    
* Figure5e_DmelSpatial_3dscatter_NewAnnotation_.html
    - 3D scatter plot of the DmelSpatial data with CAbiNet biclustering based new cell type annotations.
    
* Figure5e_DmelSpatial_3dscatter_annotation_sub_.html
    - A subset of the plot above.
