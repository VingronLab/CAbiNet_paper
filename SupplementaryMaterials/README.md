Detailed information of the files are:

* Figure2a_PBMC10x_CAbiNet_plotly.html
    - Interactive biMAP of PBMC10x data in Fig.2a. Please put the mouse cursor over the points, the information (type/biclustering/name) will automatically printed to screen.
    
* Figure5b_DmelSpatial_CAbiNet_plotly.html
    - Interactive biMAP of DemlSpatial data.
    
* Figure5e_DmelSpatial_3dscatter_NewAnnotation_.html
    - 3D scatter plot of the DmelSpatial data with CAbiNet biclustering based new cell type annotations.
    
* Figure5e_DmelSpatial_3dscatter_annotation_sub_.html
