## Supplementary Figures 9: scalability of CAbiNet

 - 1. The simulated data sets for scalability evaluation are generated with the script `/Benchmarking/data_scalability/sim_genereation.R.` You can either run this script to generate the data sets or just download them from data repository.

 -  2. Scalability of CAbiNet is then evaluated on a computer with a single thread and 16 threads, by running `/Benchmarking/data_scalability/cluster_submit.sh` and `/Benchmarking/data_scalability/cluster_submit_16t.sh`. 

 -  3. The output 'csv' files are used for running time comparison. The evaluation script can be found from `/Results/SupplFigures.ipynb`
